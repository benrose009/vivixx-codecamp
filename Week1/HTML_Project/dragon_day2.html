		<h1>HISTORY</h1>

		<h2>This holiday is known not for all people that is why here we would like to give everybody answers to all the questions. And certainly, as it is mostly unknownto many of you, why and when at all has the holiday began, we will certainly start with the discussion of its history. Right you are and you shouldn’t be surprised, that though this day exists for not so long time, it has its roots and reasons for living. If you haven’t known anything about it by now, then maybe after you catch all the idea, you will join other participants and will love this day too. So, let’s move closer to the very holiday. It began its life not so long ago but in 2004 only. Probably such a day wouldn’t have existed, but the same year women called Mrs. Paul, wrote a book about a dragon and wanted to promote it and pay as much attention to it as possible. She thought, that creating such a thematically oriented holiday would be a success. And she was right. Since that year many people support her ide even by present times, more people join it every year, new traditions and customs appear. We can only say that people love it and understand the idea. They all know well, what day World Appreciate a Dragon Day in 2018 is.</h2>
